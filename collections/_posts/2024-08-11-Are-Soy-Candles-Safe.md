    Soy candles are made from soybeans, a renewable resource, and burn cleaner with fewer harmful toxins and soot. This makes them a healthier option, especially for people with allergies or respiratory sensitivities.
    </p>
    <p>
    While this is a heavily debated topic, it's important to refer to scientific and medical evidence as much as possible. Several <a href="https://portal.nifa.usda.gov/web/crisprojectpages/0206030-soybean-candles-for-healthy-life-and-well-being.html" target="_blank">USDA studies</a> demonstrate that soy (and plant-based) wax emits negligible soot and toxic emissions compared to paraffin wax. However, to date, no peer-reviewed scientific study has collected emissions data that has proven to be harmful to human health. While all candles produce by-products of combustion, the amounts are nearly insignificant, especially when used in well ventilated indoor spaces.

    <h4>Key safety tips:</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Buy soy candles from reputable sources.</li>
    <li>Burn candles in a well ventilated space.</li>
    <li>Avoid candles that trigger allergies.</li>
    <li>Always follow candle safety guidelines.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>
    In summary, enjoy the benefits of a cleaner burn and a healthier home by using soy candles.
