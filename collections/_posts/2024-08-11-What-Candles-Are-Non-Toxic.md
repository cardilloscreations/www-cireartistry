  Non-toxic candles are typically made with natural waxes like soy, coconut, or beeswax. These candles are free from harmful chemicals and toxins often found in paraffin wax candles. However, it's also important to avoid metal wicks and fragrances that contain phthalates.

    While still being researched, several <a href="https://portal.nifa.usda.gov/web/crisprojectpages/0206030-soybean-candles-for-healthy-life-and-well-being.html" target="_blank">USDA studies</a> demonstrate that soy (and plant-based) wax emits negligible soot and toxic emissions compared to paraffin wax. According to studies, paraffin is not toxic either, but natural wax produces less toxins.

    Research has shown that Zinc or Tin core wicks are not toxic, but lead core wicks are very toxic. However, it can be difficult to know the difference unless the brand discloses their ingredients. So it's best to avoid candles with metal core wicks.

    Some fragrances from popular brands use phthalates despite <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK587442/" target="_blank">recent research</a> showing that it should be considered toxic and can adversely affect health. Choose brands that provide disclosure of ingredients and confirm they use phthalate-free fragrances.
    </p>
    <h4>Key factors to look for in non-toxic candles:</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Wax: Soy, coconut, plant-based or beeswax.</li>
    <li>Wick: Cotton, wood, or paper wicks.</li>
    <li>Fragrance: Phthalate-Free fragrances.</li>
    <li>Brand: Seek brands that disclose ingredients.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>
    By choosing candles made with these components, you can enjoy a cleaner and healthier burn while enhancing your living space with delightful aromas.
